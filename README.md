# G9_Final

These are three jupyter notebooks that were presented by me and 2 others as part of our evaluation in "Group project" for the "Development in Python" class in Term 2 of PGDM BDA.


Note: to view some interactive dashboards created using altair, you would need to download the jupyter notebook, and install the package on your interface.
